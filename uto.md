#### What is an UTO?

#### How does an ICO typically work?
To be able to understand how a UTO works, we need to first look at how a typical ICO works.

> The following view is representative of the majority of ICOs, however there are examples whose tokens have utility within the ecosystem that they were created. In which case, the ICO token has a more tangible value and usecase.

**A definition first**

An unregulated means by which funds are raised for a new cryptocurrency venture. An Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is used by startups to bypass the rigorous and regulated capital-raising process required by venture capitalists or banks. In an ICO campaign, a percentage of the cryptocurrency is sold to early backers of the project in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies.

**What does that really mean?**

It seems these days, ICO's are being created almost daily and selling out even quicker. The "investors" are hoping that the value of these coins will increase in value. We use the term investors very loosely, as most people participating in an ICO sale are speculators.

There is no guarantee that the value of these tokens will increase however almost immediately after the ICO has ended a large amount of these tokens are traded on various exchanges at some very high prices (as compared to the price to participate in the ICO).

The tokens are not being valued against the company that created them in the first place, but rather they are being valued against the current hype that is being generated and subsequently valued based on supply and demand on the exchange. Without the exchanges these tokens are essentially worthless!

**It gets worse&hellip;**

As we already mentioned, most of these tokens are not tied to anything tangible. The value of the tokens are based completely on the hype of the ICO and the subsequent market exchange. The companies that launch the ICOs have no accountability to deliver upon any promises they make.

So, these companies launch an ICO to raise some funds. But no only that they also create or retain a large number of the same tokens for themselves. What are these tokens used for? There is only one purpose and that is to trade them on the exchange to make even more crypto.

You should ask yourself seriously why a company would be selling off their newly acquired (from thin air) tokens immediately on the exchanges when they have already raised such a large amount of crypto from the ICO itself.
