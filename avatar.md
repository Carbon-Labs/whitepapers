## Disclaimer <a name="disclaimer"></a>
While this document does not preclude [Liberation Online](#liberation-online) from offering holders of AVATAR tokens a share of the revenue generated from the commercial applications of the AVATAR ecosystem, such offer, if any, and the extent thereof will be at the sole and absolute discretion of Liberation Online.

No AVATAR token should be construed, interpreted, classified or treated as enabling, or affording any opportunity to AVATAR token holders to participate in or to receive profits, income, or other payments or returns arising from or in connection with the AVATAR ecosytem, the AVATAR tokens or the proceeds of the AVATAR token sale, or to receive sums paid out of such profits, income, or other payments or returns.  

## Introduction to AVATAR <a name="introduction"></a>
AVATAR puts you back in control of your online identity! You should be able to access the internet freely without having to give up your personal information.

In this day in age, it seems everyone knows more about us than we know ourselves. Companies are collecting data about us as much as they can and matching it to our known identities (email addresses, phone numbers, social media accounts etc etc).

We should not be complacent about giving out this information as easily as we do now. The data is sold to thousands of companies from around the world. Companies that we know nothing about, know far to much about ourselves.

We need more control over what data we give up and who we give it up to. There are of course many reasons that giving up this data is valid but sometimes not in the way you may think. For example, a company asking for your date of birth to prove you are older than 18 before viewing a page could just as easily ask the question are you older than 18. You could confirm this without giving up personal details such as your birthdate (which is used in many fraud and identity thefts).

_**AVATAR provides a better way.**_

#### Secure Login
> A one click, cryptographically secure login solution that does not require prior registration.
#### Data Protection
> Your data is yours, you own it and you control it.

None of your data is stored anywhere but on your own devices. In building up your AVATAR profile, you can selectively choose to answer questions that are presented to you. The answers to these questions are stored on your device only.

You are in complete control as to who can see this information. Much like filling out a traditional form on a website, but we make it much easier for you to decide what information you allow to be sent and to who.

#### Personalised Anonymity
> The connected world your way.


#### Data Monetisation
> Get paid for your data. No more middle men selling your data without your knowledge.
