## Disclaimer <a name="disclaimer"></a>
While this document does not preclude [Liberation Online](#liberation-online) from offering holders of AVATAR tokens a share of the revenue generated from the commercial applications of the AVATAR ecosystem, such offer, if any, and the extent thereof will be at the sole and absolute discretion of Liberation Online.

No AVATAR token should be construed, interpreted, classified or treated as enabling, or affording any opportunity to AVATAR token holders to participate in or to receive profits, income, or other payments or returns arising from or in connection with the AVATAR ecosytem, the AVATAR tokens or the proceeds of the AVATAR token sale, or to receive sums paid out of such profits, income, or other payments or returns.  

## Introduction to AVATAR <a name="introduction"></a>
AVATAR puts you back in control of your online identity! You should be able to access the internet freely without having to give up your personal information.

In this day in age, it seems everyone knows more about us than we know ourselves. Companies are collecting data about us as much as they can and matching it to our known identities (email addresses, phone numbers, social media accounts etc etc).

We should not be complacent about giving out this information as easily as we do now. The data is sold to thousands of companies from around the world. Companies that we know nothing about, know far too much about ourselves.

We need more control over what data we give up and who we give it up to. There are of course many reasons that giving up this data is valid but sometimes not in the way you may think. For example, a company asking for your date of birth to prove you are older than 18 before viewing a page could just as easily ask the question are you older than 18. You could confirm this without giving up personal details such as your birthdate (which is used in many fraud and identity thefts).

_**AVATAR provides a better way.**_

## What is AVATAR? <a name="what-is-avatar"></a>
> AVATAR is an identity and authentication manager that puts you in control of your data.

AVATAR allows you to share with clients (websites, app, etc) details about your identity that you choose to share.

The AVATAR ecosystem allows clients to request information directly from you.

You can create as many different AVATARS as you need.

Each of us have different identities depending on what situation we are in. We express ourselves in many different ways. For example, your identity that you show to your friends is different to that you show to your boss.

> An Identity is simply a set of attributes related to an entity.

In our case the entity is your AVATAR and the set of attributes your AVATAR has is defined by you by answering some simple questions. The answers to these questions will become the datapoints that clients can request.


As another example, let's look at some of the different identities of a Woman:

  - Mother
  - Daughter
  - Wife
  - Friend
  - Girlfriend
  - Community Member
  - Boss
  - Colleague
  - and so on.

The same thing goes for when you interact with different clients. You want to be able to provide different dataponts for different situations.

AVATAR is your identity that you are in control of.

As well as managing online identity, AVATAR also provides a quick, easy and secure method of logging in to various clients.

No longer do you need to remember the various username and password combinations that you have setup. You also, do not need to worry about security breaches and people accessing these sites without your knowledge.

_Perhaps you wish to simply comment on a blog post. Rather than having to go through the tedious process of "signing up" to uniquely identify yourself on the website, you can login using your AVATAR (the one you choose to use). You will have instant access along with a unique and secure identity on that system where no one can impersonate you. Whenever you revisit the site, you simply login again using the same AVATAR. No account, no usernames, no passwords, Nothing to remember or forget, NO HASSLE!_

The same AVATAR can be used for as many different websites that you wish.

**AVATARS are both user and site specific.**
To maintain anonymity as much as possible, your AVATAR always presents the same AVATAR ID to the same client, but an entirely different one to every other client. There is no way for cross-site coupling of AVATAR IDs.

## What is the KIWI token? <a name="what-is-kiwi-token"></a>
The KIWI is a utility token, rather than a security. The KIWI will be used as the preferred payment method in exchange of all products, services and tools being developed by [Liberation Online](#liberation-online) as well as a growing number of other businesses.

The KIWI is an open source mineable ERC20 / ERC918 token. The KIWI is a token that anyone can mine, buy and sell.

For more information, please visit http://thekiwi.online

#### The KIWI Token in AVATAR
(DRAFT) The KIWI will be the cryptocurrency that powers AVATAR. Companies that wish to utilise AVATAR in their own website and apps will need to spend KIWI to do so.

## The AVATAR Token <a name="what-is-avatar-token"></a>
### Token Sale & Distribution
We will not be raising funds in the traditional ICO model as we believe this model is flawed and does not protect the token owners enough. Rather, we have developed a new fund raising model that we have called UTO (Unlimited Token Offer). For more details on how UTO works please read our whitepaper [here](uto.md).

For AVATAR, the UTO will be run with the following settings:

Field | Value
----------|:---------:
Token Name  | AVATAR
Token Symbol | AVATAR
Decimals | 8
Number of tokens per ETH | 100
Cooling off period | 152470 blocks
Percentage Held | 20%

For clarification, for every 1 ETH invested a total of 100 AVATAR tokens will be created, 80 for the investor and 20 for Liberation Online. The ETH is locked into the contract and is not accessible by anyone including Liberation Online other than by selling AVATAR tokens back to the contract. The sold AVATAR tokens are burned and the equivalent ETH is released to the AVATAR token holder.

We also want to highlight a cooling off period, whereby you can get back all of your ETH that you have invested should you choose to. The cooling off period is specified in blocks but an aproximation of "time" can be caluclated as well.

### Use of the Sale Proceeds
Liberation Online will use all funding received through its share of the crowdfunding proceeds to support ongoing development of the AVATAR ecosystem.

Most of the funding will initially be used for developer salaries and bounties for open-source contributions to AVATAR.

### Return on Investment
AVATAR token ownership represents your ownership of the AVATAR ecosystem. At any time you like you will be able to sell back your AVATAR tokens to the exchange and receive the equivalent percentage of KIWI and ETH that is held in the contract.

The smart contract that issues AVATAR will also be the payment wallet for the AVATAR ecosystem.

## The AVATAR Solution <a name="avatar-solution"></a>

### Secure Login
> A one click, cryptographically secure login solution that does not require prior registration.

Users are embracing one click social login functionality via Facebook, Google, GitHub etc for its ease of use.

It is easy to understand why&hellip;

Manually authenticating yourself on a website or app is tiresome. Users are usually presented with a form that asks for their username or email address and a password. Or, as an alternative and mentioned above, they may be presented with the option of logging in using one click social login functionality.

So, the user has to answer themselves the following:

1. Do I already have an account for this service?
2. If so, did I use an email and password, or one of the social login providers to sign up?
3. If I used an email and password, what is my password?

The user has to do this for every website or app they use.

This is a very tedious process, and it is estimated that the typical user now interacts with over 100 different services. Remembering unique account details for all of these services (many of which are used infrequently) is infeasible. So instead, users use weak easy to remember passwords that they usually use on more than one service.

From a security standpoint this is a disaster.

Even though it is the most common form of authentication currently in use, it is both impractical and prone to security breaches.

And according to a [survey](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/1/prweb9086226.htm) conducted in 2012, users are very resistant to traditional registration processes:

- 86% people are bothered by the need to create new accounts when registering on a website and will change their beahaivour as a result.

  - 54% may leave the site or not return.
  - 26% go to a different site if possible.
  - 6% leave/avoid the site.
  - 14% say they will complete the registration.

- 88% admit to having given incorrect information or left forms incomplete when creating a new account at a website.
- 90% admit they have left a website if they forgot their password or login information, instead of answering security questions or re-setting their password.

Social media login however, does provide the following benefits:

1. No more form filling.
2. No need to remember yet another username / password combination.
3. Quick and easy.

However, it also raises huge privacy concerns. The users information is loaded from external providers. These providers are private companies that make money by data mining and selling that data to other companies without your knowledge.

###### AVATAR Login Walkthrough

AVATAR solves all of this by bringing together several technologies to make authenticating with services quick and easy. No need to remember anything. And no need to be worried about data breaches.

The services that wants you to authenticate displays a QR code on the login screen. You use your phone to scan the QR code and can be logged in instantly.

The QR code that is presented is unique everytime it is presented. At a minimum it includes the following:

- service identifier (for websites, this is the website address)
- nonce

When you scan the QR code, your phone will sign the nonce (signature) and post it back to the service that you wish to access.

The service will receive the nonce, signature and the AVATAR public address. Using these 3 bits of information the service can cryptographically verify that the nonce has been signed correctly and thus you are authenticated.


### Data Protection
> Your data is yours, you own it and you control it.

None of your data is stored anywhere but on your own devices. In building up your AVATAR profile, you can selectively choose to answer questions that are presented to you. The answers to these questions are stored on your device only.

You are in complete control as to who can see this information. Much like filling out a traditional form on a website, but we make it much easier for you to decide what information you allow to be sent and to who.

This also provides companies with more sanitised data; that is the information that they receive from you is going to be more accurate. You can update your information with ease at anytime.

### Personalised Anonymity
> The connected world your way.



### Data Monetisation
> Get paid for your data. No more middle men selling your data without your knowledge.

## Adoption and Collaboration <a name="adoption"></a>
The key to this technology will be the widespread adoption of the AVATAR ecosystem. We will work with a number of providers, developers and integrators to ensure adoption is as easy as possible.
